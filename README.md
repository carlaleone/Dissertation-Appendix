# Dissertation Appendix
This repository contains the code provided in the appendix of the undergraduate dissertation of Carla Leone in the degree of Ecological and Environmenal Sciences at the University of Edinburgh.

# Code for Acoustic Index Calculations and Statistical Analysis
## The code and data included in this appendix is:
- [Meta data](https://github.com/carlaleone/Dissertation-Appendix/blob/main/final_merged.xlsx) 
- [Splitting .wav files](https://github.com/carlaleone/Dissertation-Appendix/blob/main/splitting_sound_files.R)
- [Calculating acoustic indices](https://github.com/carlaleone/Dissertation-Appendix/blob/main/acoustic_indices.R)
- Question 1: [Univariate analyses](https://github.com/carlaleone/Dissertation-Appendix/blob/main/Appendix_Unvariate.R)
- Question 2: [NMDS, PERMANOVA, SIMPER](https://github.com/carlaleone/Dissertation-Appendix/blob/main/Appendix_NMDS.R)
- Question 3: [Random Forest Models](https://github.com/carlaleone/Dissertation-Appendix/blob/main/Appendix_RF.R)
- [Mapping ](https://github.com/carlaleone/Dissertation-Appendix/blob/main/Map.R)

The script for splitting .wav files was adapted from Key et al and de Clippele et al  (2023). The script for acoustic index calculations was adapted from Williams et al (2022). 

The following R packages were used throughout the scripts:
- `soundecology`
- `vegan`
- `tidyverse`
- `seewave`
- `tuneR`
- `randomForest `
- `caret`
- `ggmap`
