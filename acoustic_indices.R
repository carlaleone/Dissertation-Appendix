### Are you running on all audio files within a folder? The use this:

wav_files = dir(path, pattern =".WAV") #may need to change '.wav' to upper or lowercase


### Are you running on a subset of files in the folder? Then use these lines if executing over files specified by suffix:

#vector_of_files = file_name_ends[,1] #Reads the list of applicable suffixes
#wav_files = vector() #Creates empty vector
#for(i in 1:length(vector_of_files)){
#  wav_files = c(wav_files, dir(path, pattern = vector_of_files[i])) #Adds files to the empty vector
#}
#print(length(wav_files)) #tells you how many eligible files in the folder, check this appears correct
